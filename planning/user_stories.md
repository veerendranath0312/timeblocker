## User Stories

- [ ] As an Individual Planner, I want to create a secure account and log in, so that I can save my plans and access them from any device.
- [ ] As an Individual Planner, I want a "Tasks" list with checkboxes, so that I can quickly capture to-dos as they arise without cluttering my schedule.
