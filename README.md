## About

### Description

Time Blocker is a minimalist web application that digitizes author Cal Newport's proven time-blocking methodology. The core of the application is a clean, intuitive interface that helps you move from a reactive, distraction-filled day to a proactive and intentional one.

It features a unique two-panel layout:

- **The Collection Page**: A dedicated space on the left to quickly capture tasks, notes, and daily metrics, just like the collection page in a physical planner.

- **The Time Block Grid**: A visual, vertical timeline on the right where you can design your day. Simply drag tasks from your collection page and drop them onto the grid to assign them a specific time.

The application is built for the reality that plans change. When interruptions occur, you can easily adapt your schedule by dragging, dropping, and resizing time blocks, providing the flexibility of a digital tool with the focused clarity of pen and paper.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this application is to solve the problem of "productivity app burnout" and the reactive nature of modern knowledge work. Many digital tools, in an attempt to be all-in-one solutions, become overly complex and a source of distraction themselves. Users often spend more time organizing their productivity app than doing the actual work.

This project provides an opinionated and simple alternative. Instead of offering endless features, it provides a proven framework for focus, helping users to:

- **Give Every Minute a Job**: Intentionally plan the day to balance important "deep work" with urgent shallow tasks.

- **Separate Capture from Planning**: By physically separating the task list from the schedule, the app reduces the cognitive load of a long to-do list and prevents the constant temptation to clutter the calendar.

- **Adapt with Ease**: The purpose of the app's drag-and-drop interface is to digitally replicate this fluid, realistic planning process.

- **Enable Clear Shutdowns**: The "Shutdown Complete" checkbox, taken directly from the planner template, is a key feature designed to help users consciously end their workday, reduce work-related anxiety, and prevent burnout.

### Inspiration

This project is directly inspired by Cal Newport's physical Time-Block Planner and his underlying philosophy of time management, which he has advocated for over fifteen years.

The core idea is to create the definitive digital version of Newport's system, which emphasizes replacing stressful busyness with empowering intention. The application is built for users who want to practice "Deep Work" and apply principles of digital minimalism to their daily planning.
