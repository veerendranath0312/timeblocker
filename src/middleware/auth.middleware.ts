/**
 * This file contains authentication middleware functions.
 * Middleware functions are used to intercept and process requests before they reach
 * route handlers. This file will contain functions like:
 * - JWT token verification
 * - User authentication checks
 * - Authorization checks (ensuring users have permission to access certain resources)
 * These middleware functions are applied to routes that require authentication.

import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

// Authentication middleware functions will be implemented here
// Example:
// export const authenticate = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): void => {
//   // Implementation
