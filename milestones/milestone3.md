## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Successfully completed the authentication part. Need to integrate frontend with backend.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The main challenges we are facing is that we are unable to replicate the exact design of our application.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We tried to complete all the tasks in this sprint. But due to some techincal issues we are unable to complete some tasks.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I felt that tasks creation is at risk. But now I got an idea who to achieve that. But the main at risk task is implementing the time block grid. Need to check another alternative we were unable to achieve this.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Need support with the people who knows about the React calendar schedular support.
