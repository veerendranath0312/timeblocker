## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Using Figma, we successfully designed the two main pages of our application. At first, we were unfamiliar with the tool, but after learning how to use it, we were able to create the pages — an accomplishment that made us proud and happy.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the main challenges we faced was creating wireframes. We were initially uncertain about whether to use low-fidelity or high-fidelity wireframes. Eventually, we decided to go with high-fidelity wireframes, as they provided a clearer understanding and better visualization for the development phase of our application.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I believe our project is quite ambitious, especially when it comes to replicating Cal Newport’s time-blocking methodology in a digital format. Creating a multi-grid time-blocking system will likely be one of our biggest challenges in the coming weeks. If you’re familiar with this approach, your guidance could really help us achieve what we’ve planned.
