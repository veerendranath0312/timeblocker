## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The initial ideation and research phase went exceptionally well, largely due to the clear visual inspiration provided.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

- Resisting "Feature Creep": The biggest challenge was maintaining discipline and resisting the temptation to add unnecessary features.

- Capturing the "Analog" Feel: A significant conceptual challenge we faced is how to translate the tactile, mindful experience of using a paper planner into a digital format.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

- **UI/UX Design Expertise**: To overcome the challenge of capturing the "analog feel," we will need support from a skilled UI/UX designer.

- **Structured User Testing**: To validate that our digital version of the planner template is effective in practice, we will need support in setting up a structured user testing and feedback process. Guidance on recruiting beta testers (ideally from our target audience) and implementing tools to gather and analyze their feedback will be crucial for refining the product.
