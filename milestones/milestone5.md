### Custom Features

👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Check off each completed feature below.

- [x] The project gracefully handles errors
- [x] The project includes a one-to-one database relationship
- [x] The project includes a slide-out pane or modal as appropriate for your use case that pops up and covers the page content without navigating away from the current page
- [x] The project includes a unique field within the join table
- [ ] The project includes a custom non-RESTful route with corresponding controller actions
- [x] The user can filter or sort items based on particular criteria as appropriate for your use case
- [x] Data is automatically generated in response to a certain event or user action. Examples include generating a default inventory for a new user starting a game or creating a starter set of tasks for a user creating a new task app account
- [ ] Data submitted via a POST or PATCH request is validated before the database is updated (e.g. validating that an event is in the future before allowing a new event to be created)
  - [ ] _To receive full credit, please be sure to demonstrate in your walkthrough that for certain inputs, the item will NOT be successfully created or updated._

### Stretch Features

👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Check off each completed feature below.

- [x] A subset of pages require the user to log in before accessing the content
  - [ ] Users can log in and log out via GitHub OAuth with Passport.js
- [ ] Restrict available user options dynamically, such as restricting available purchases based on a user's currency
- [ ] Show a spinner while a page or page element is loading
- [ ] Disable buttons and inputs during the form submission process
- [ ] Disable buttons after they have been clicked
  - _At least 75% of buttons in your app must exhibit this behavior to receive full credit_
- [ ] Users can upload images to the app and have them be stored on a cloud service
  - _A user profile picture does **NOT** count for this rubric item **only if** the app also includes "Login via GitHub" functionality._
  - _Adding a photo via a URL does **NOT** count for this rubric item (for example, if the user provides a URL with an image to attach it to the post)._

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Finally we complete majority of the features in our application

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the main challenges we faced was migrating from Firebase authentication to a custom JWT and OAuth implementation. This required redesigning the entire authentication system, including the database schema, middleware, and frontend state management. We also encountered TypeScript compilation errors related to Express type definitions and Drizzle ORM compatibility, which required careful debugging and type assertion work. Additionally, integrating the backend APIs with the frontend Zustand store while maintaining proper error handling and loading states was complex, especially when dealing with date-based data structures and ensuring all UI components update correctly when the date changes.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

We're particularly proud of building a fully functional resource time grid calendar from scratch, similar to professional scheduling tools. The "replan" feature, which allows users to mark events as completed and activate new planning columns, was a complex state management challenge that we successfully implemented. We're also proud of creating a clean, minimalist UI that stays true to Cal Newport's time-blocking philosophy while providing modern digital functionality. The seamless integration between the collection page (tasks, notes, metrics) and the time block grid, with real-time updates across all components, represents a significant achievement in state management and user experience design.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

Since the beginning of the course, we've grown significantly in several areas. We've moved from basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript to building full-stack applications with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. We've learned to work with modern tools like TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, Zustand for state management, and proper authentication patterns. We've also developed better debugging skills, especially when dealing with complex issues like infinite re-render loops, database migration conflicts, and API integration challenges. Most importantly, we've learned to think about application architecture holistically, considering how frontend state, backend APIs, and database schemas work together to create a cohesive user experience.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

Our goals include continuing to build more complex full-stack applications, potentially exploring technologies like Next.js for server-side rendering, GraphQL for more efficient data fetching, and cloud deployment platforms beyond Render. We want to deepen our understanding of database design, API architecture, and performance optimization. We plan to contribute to open-source projects, build personal projects that solve real problems, and continue learning through online courses and documentation. We're also interested in exploring mobile app development using React Native to extend our web development skills to cross-platform applications.
