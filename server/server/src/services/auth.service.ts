/**
 * This file contains the authentication service/business logic functions.
 * Services contain the core business logic and interact with models to perform
 * data operations. They are called by controllers and handle operations like:
 * - User registration logic
 * - Password hashing and verification
 * - Token generation and validation
 * - User authentication logic
 * Services separate business logic from HTTP request/response handling.
 */

// Authentication service functions will be implemented here
// Example:
// export const registerUser = async (email: string, password: string): Promise<User> => {
//   // Implementation
// };
