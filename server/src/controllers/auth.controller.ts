/**
 * This file contains the authentication controller functions.
 * Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses for authentication-related endpoints.
 * They receive requests from routes, call service functions to process business logic,
 * and return appropriate HTTP responses to the client.
 * This file will contain functions like login, register, logout, etc.
